## Study Design

This section contains information on how the data for the Coursera Data Science Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project was collected and summarized.

A zip file containing the time window data training and test data and associated metadata, such as `activity_labels.txt`, and `features.txt`, of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset was downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  The training and test datasets were combined.  Each row of the combined data set represents one observation of a 2.56 second time window, containing 561 variables summarizing the 128 raw data observations (50 observations a second from the gyroscope and accelerometer).  

The script `run_analysis.R` generates two files: HAR-timewindow.txt and HAR-subject-activity-mean.txt.

In the table "HAR-timewindow.txt" only the summarization variables representing means and standard deviations were included.  Specifically only the 79 variables containing the word "mean" or "std" in their names were included, with the exception of the "angle" variables which represented the angle between vectors instead of a mean or standard deviation.  In the "HAR-timewindow.txt" table, each row corresponds to a single time window observation of a subject and an activity.  

In the table "HAR-subject-activity-mean.txt", the data was further summarized by taking the mean of all the observations for each of the 79 variables per unique combination of subject and activity.  There ranged from 36 to 95 time windows associated with each combination of subject and activity.  The variable names in the file were prefixed with "subject-activity-mean-" to reflect that that these values are the mean of the corresponding time window values for each subject-activity group.

## Code Book

This section contains specific information each variable (column) included in the uploaded table, HAR-subject-activity-mean.txt.  Most of the variables are summarizations of variables with the same name and description in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).  The variables are described in the `features_info.txt` and `README.txt` in that dataset.  Please see those files for more details.  

Units (according to the `README.txt` file):

- For all accelerometer-related variables (containing the word "Acc" in the variable name), the units are in standard gravity units 'g'.
- For all gyroscope-related variables (containing the word "Gyro" in the variable name), the units are radians/second.

Quoting from `features_info.txt`, here is an additional description of the variables:

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filt er with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
> 
> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
> 
> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
> 
> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
